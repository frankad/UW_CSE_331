Describe which parts of your code belong to the model, the view,
the controller, or none of these.  (See the assignment for details.)

Note:I added a new method eqauls and hasCode on hw5/DierctGraph.java class. 
	Because some of the JUnit test of pathDataParser in the CampusDataParserTest.java
	was failed. So, after I added those methods and used trim() in the string 
	representation of DierctGraph to remove extera spaces then everything is fixed.   
	
The model classes are: CampusDataParser.java, PathFindingModel, and PointCoordinate.java.
So, the CampusDataParser class load the campus buildings and campus paths dataset; the 
PointCoordinate class represents basically the 2D point class that model the building
location and rectangular coordinates.PathFindingModel has contain most of the logical
and computation process to find the shoretest path, to get the building namess, location
and coordinates. Thus as a model they have the state of the obiect, can accepts a command 
and change states. 

The view and controller class is PathFindingControllerView. As the name indicate view and 
controler method implemented together. It represents the visualization of the data that 
the model classes contain, and also controls the data flow into model object and updates 
the view whenever data changes. The method implemented in this class, such as listBuildings
shortestRoute display information to the user. On the other hand, the main method used as 
a controller because it accepts the input data from the user, and also act as a view when 
the user display/print some information, it calls the print command which are view.
