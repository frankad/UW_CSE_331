# Test a case list of nodes in the graph and list of children of the parent node. It also
# tests when multiple edges added beween two nodes. So, it prints list of nodes in the graph
# and the children of parent nodes in order way. It also test when there are two or more 
# edges/routes between two nodes. The abbreviations are UW buildings.
