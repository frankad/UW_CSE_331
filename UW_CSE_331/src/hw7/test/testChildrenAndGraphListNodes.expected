# Test a case list of nodes in the graph and list of children of the parent node. It also
# tests when multiple edges added beween two nodes. So, it prints list of nodes in the graph
# and the children of parent nodes in order way. It also test when there are two or more 
# edges/routes between two nodes. The abbreviations are UW buildings.
# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add nodes 
added node HUB to graph1
added node MGH to graph1
added node GUG to graph1
added node MOR to graph1

# Add edges between nodes
added edge 1.800 from HUB to MGH in graph1
added edge 1.500 from HUB to MGH in graph1
added edge 1.250 from HUB to MOR in graph1
added edge 1.300 from MGH to GUG in graph1
added edge 1.500 from MGH to GUG in graph1
added edge 1.650 from GUG to MOR in graph1
added edge 1.900 from MOR to GUG in graph1

# List the nodes in the graph
graph1 contains: GUG HUB MGH MOR
the children of HUB in graph1 are: MGH(1.500) MGH(1.800) MOR(1.250) 
the children of MGH in graph1 are: GUG(1.300) GUG(1.500)
the children of GUG in graph1 are: MOR(1.650)
the children of MOR in graph1 are: GUG(1.900)
