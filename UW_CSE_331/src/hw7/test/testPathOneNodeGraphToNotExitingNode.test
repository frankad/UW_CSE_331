# Test a case to find path using oneNodeGraph from the node that exist inside
# the graph to some not existing nodes say, Jeff and David

# Load oneNodeGraph.tsv
LoadGraph oneNodeGraph oneNodeGraph.tsv

# Find the minimum-cost path from  existing(Eva) to non-existing(Jeff or David) node and vice versa
FindPath oneNodeGraph Eva Jeff
