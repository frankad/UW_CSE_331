# Sample testing: a case list children of node for three node and three edges:
# It tests to list the children node and edge added to the graph 
# it can be created from three nodes and edge between them can be added.
# Then a lsit of node in the graph and children nodes of each node can be
# printed out.

# Create a graph
CreateGraph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
AddNode graph1 n1
AddNode graph1 n2
AddNode graph1 n3

# Add edges
AddEdge graph1 n1 n2 e1
AddEdge graph1 n1 n3 e2
AddEdge graph1 n2 n3 e3

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1, n2
ListNodes graph1
ListChildren graph1 n1
ListChildren graph1 n2
