# Sample testing: a case list children of node for three node and three edges:
# It tests to list the children node and edge added to the graph 
# it can be created from three nodes and edge between them can be added.
# Then a lsit of node in the graph and children nodes of each node can be
# printed out.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge e3 from n2 to n3 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1, n2
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n3(e2)
the children of n2 in graph1 are: n3(e3)
