Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

  I changed made in hw5/DirectGraph

1. I changed the method getAllNodes(). Originally i used collection AddAll methods. However, it makes slow 
  the process/excusion time.So, instead return immidately an object like, new TreeSet<T>(directGraph.keySet()). 

2. Originally, I used checkRep() in some of my methods such as addEdge, edgesOfNode, removeEdge, checkEdgeExist,
 and getChildren. However, it made the run time very slow. Thus, when chechRep() call in those method, it goes 
 all the way to check the graph and every node in the graph from the begining. Thus, due to this complexities of  
 various operations increase the runtime. So, when I removed it after I got advice from TA's, it work properly and
 the run time decreased half.
