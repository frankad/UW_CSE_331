# build graph
loaded graph graphWithOneNode

# test the graph is building process
graphWithOneNode contains: Eva
the children of Eva in graphWithOneNode are:
the children of David in graphWithOneNode are: node David is not found in the graph

# test BFS/findPathBFS
path from Eva to Eva:
unknown character David
